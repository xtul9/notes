# Notes

A notes app that nobody asked for.  
Just my contribution to the modern world I suppose.

## Features

- Data is stored in a cloud, so your secrets are safe with Google
- Notes are locked behind credentials for extra protection from your wife's hacking attempts
- Unimpressive UI
- A total lack of thought put into UX
- Zero quality control
- Isn't .NET so should (could (mayhaps)) prove I'm a problem solver 1st and a programmer 2nd
- Multiple languages to choose from (two, actually)

## Things to do

- Add dependency injection so I can actually do unit tests
- Lead to 100% unit test coverage (think it would look funny)
- More stuff that would make the tech interviewers be like "uhh hmm yeah this guy knows his stuff"
- Release on Android app store
- Release on Cloudflare Pages
