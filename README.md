# Notes

A notes app that nobody asked for.  
Just my contribution to the modern world I suppose.

## Features

- Data is stored in a cloud, so your secrets are safe with Google
- Notes are locked behind credentials for extra protection from your wife's hacking attempts
- Unimpressive UI
- A total lack of thought put into UX
- Zero quality control
- 100% unit test coverage despite the sheer size of the codebase
- Isn't .NET so should prove I'm a problem solver 1st and a programmer 2nd
